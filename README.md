# InternRegistration
Internship Registration System
Description:-

The idea is to have a list of interns and a list of projects.

New interns can be added as well as new projects.

One intern can be a part of one or many projects.

One project can have many interns.

At any given point if one intern is selected then a list of projects where the selected intern is involved must be displayed.

The table for interns will be as follows:

Internid, fullname, address, branch.

Internid should be integer and auto_increment.

the table for projects is as follows:

projid, projectname, domaintype (will be Finance, network or health)

There will be a third table which will hold the data associating students with respective projects.

This is to be decided by the intern.

Database can be of intern's choice.

Front end must allow to add interns, add projects and assign intern to projects.

While adding an intern, the list of all available projects should be shown and also total of projects to which that intern is already assigned.

Frontend technology would be javascript, CSS and HTML.

Use of libraries such as jquery, bootstrap or even react is encouraged.

The backend API must be REST with urls for GET,POST.

Backend technology could be Python, nodejs or anything as per choice.
